### Usage

`py-vigenere-cracker.py -i <input_file> [-o <output_file>][-p <plaintext_file>][-c <coincidence_index_value>]`

For the cracking algorithm is based on the coincidence index of a language (each language has a characteristic coincidence index) - representing the different letters distribution -, it is needed a coincidence index value (by default it is 0.052 for english). 

Also, a plaintext in the text language is needed, by default it is an english plaintext.
